START
run program

Ask user for name

program checks what the time is

dependant on what the time is, specifically what hour of the the day we are on
program chooses and print one of the four options

if Hour >6 "go back to bed" or "you shouldnt be awake"
meaning its gonna select option 1 between 00-06
    if Hour is not between 00-06, it should try the next option
if Hour >12 "good morning"
    meaning option 2 is selected if its over 06 and between 12
if Hour >16 "Good afternoon" or "good day"

if Hour > 24 "good evening" 

once the porgram figures out what time of day it is, throught hours.
    it selects an display message and prints it

it combines the users name with the time of day message
    looking something like

    INPUT: Alex 
    Program run, time of day is 12:34 
    Program displays "Good afternoon, Alex. it's Thursday 12:34"

The Program then adds and prints a randomly selected (from the list) Quote from the QuoteOfTheDay selector

displaying the quote after the initial greeting message.

END


TL;DR:

INPUT: name
TimeOfDay, destilled to Hour
use hour to select option
prints: 1/4 message options + Name + day + time
QuoteOfTheDay runs and randomly selects and prints a quote
